        <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:28px">The meerkat</b> <i><b style="color:lightgreen">(Suricata
                    suricatta)</b></i> or suricate is a
            small
            mongoose
            found in southern
            Africa.
            It is
            characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail, and a brindled
            coat
            pattern. The head-and-body length is around <i><sub style="color:greenyellow">(24–35 cm (9.4–13.8
                    in)</sub></i>, and the weight is
            typically between <sub><i style="color:greenyellow">(0.62 and
                    0.97 kg (1.4 and 2.1 lb)</i></sub>. The coat is light grey to yellowish-brown with alternate,
            poorly-defined light and
            dark bands on the back. Meerkats have foreclaws adapted for digging and have the ability to thermoregulate
            to
            survive in their harsh, dry habitat. Three subspecies are recognised.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>Meerkats are highly social, and form packs of two to 30 individuals each that occupy home ranges
            around<sub><i style="color:greenyellow">(5 km2
                    (1.9 sq mi)</i></sub> in area. There is a social hierarchy—generally dominant individuals in a pack
            breed and produce
            offspring, and the nonbreeding, subordinate members provide altruistic care to the pups. Breeding occurs
            around the year, with peaks during heavy rainfall; after a gestation of <sub><i>60 to 70</i></sub> days, a
            litter of three to
            seven pups is born.</p>
    </div>

        <p>They live in rock crevices in stony, often calcareous areas, and in large burrow systems in plains. The
            burrow systems, typically 5 m (16 ft) in diameter with around 15 openings, are large underground networks
            consisting of two to three levels of tunnels. These tunnels are around 7.5 cm (3.0 in) high at the top and
            wider below, and extend up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) into the ground. Burrows have moderated internal
            temperatures and provide a comfortable microclimate that protects meerkats in harsh weather and at extreme
            temperatures.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Meerkats are active during the day, mostly in the early morning and late afternoon; they remain continually
            alert and retreat to burrows when sensing danger. They use a broad variety of calls to communicate among one
            another for different purposes, for example to raise an alarm on sighting a predator. Primarily
            insectivorous, meerkats feed heavily on beetles and lepidopterans, arthropods, amphibians, small birds,
            reptiles, and plant material in their diet.</p>
